## Master Branch 
*  This is the main branch Where the program exists [Main branch]

## We can make a Feature Branch
*  This branch is used for adding new features to the project
*  Changes done in this branch wont show in the main branch(Master)
*  if you switch to master branch you won't see the changes
*  It's like a sandbox where you write your code make it perfect before merging with main branch

## HOTFIX
*  This branch is made and used for fixing the bugs in the projects
